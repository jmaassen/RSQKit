## How can I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for my code release?

### Description 
Obtaining a DOI (a type of persistent identifier) for your software has become [increasingly popular][datacite-doi-software] to indicate others how to cite your software (either in a publication or as an independent way of referring to your software versions). In this document we describe how to obtain a DOI to refer to your software releases.

### Considerations 
* You use [GitHub][github] as your software repository
* You make software releases (e.g. using [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning])
* You would like a DOI for your software releases
* You use or are happy to make an account on the [Zenodo][zenodo] archive 

### Solutions 

* Link your GitHub repository to Zenodo
	* Go to Zenodo.
	* If you donâ€™t have an account, make an account.
	* Navigate to your [Zenodo my account page](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/profile)
	* Click on the GitHub option, Click on Connect
	* Authorise Zenodo to access your GitHub account
	* Choose which repository you would like to create a DOI for under the repositories sections
		* You may need to scroll down to find the repository if you have access to many repositories

* [Create a GitHub release](https://everse.software/RSQKit/releasing_code) for the repository you have enabled. 
	* Go to your repository
	* Click on releases and then on Draft a new release
	* Remember to use a version number (semantic versioning is the common standard but there are other schemes such as [CalVer][calver] which is date based)-->
	
* Zenodo will automatically archive this release:
	* Once your GitHub repository is linked to Zenodo, any new release you publish on GitHub will be archived by Zenodo
	* Zenodo will automatically issue a DOI for your release

* Get the DOI:
	* After the GitHub release, go to Zenodo, where you will see your repository archived with a DOI assigned to it. Your badge is available in "Details":

![Badge in Zenodo](../../images/badge_zenodo.png)

* Copy the badge in your README file:
	* Now you can add the Zenodo badge in your GitHub repository. Click on the blue DOI and copy the markdown in your README. It will show as follows:
