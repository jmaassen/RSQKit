## How to Create Code Releases
 
### Description

Software needs to be released regularly.
The points in time are described by the software development life cycle.
Software Project Management Platforms like [GitHub][github] and [GitLab][gitlab] offer features to release your software.

### Considerations

* Naming schemes for the version of the release can be very diverse serving different purposes, for example [Semantic Versioning][semantic-versioning] (SemVer; e.g. "1.0.0") and [Calendar Versioning][calendar-versioning] (CalVer; e.g. "24.10").
* A Changelog can be given with the release to describe the changes made.
* Attachments like built binaries or packages or other software artefacts can be provided.

### Solutions

* GitHub: Small to large and closed-source to open-source software projects
  * Go to your source code repository.
  * Click on releases and then on "Draft a new release"
  * Remember to use a version number with the considerations listed above.
  * Click on "Publish release"
